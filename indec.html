          <b>I'm a master student at Chicago State University</b> in
          Chicago studying computer science. I have
          experience developing and designing software for the web, from
          simple landing pages to progressive web applications. I strive to
          create software that not only functions efficiently under the
          hood, but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user
          experiences with clean, efficient, and scalable code. I consider
          work an ongoing education, and I'm always looking for
          opportunities to work with those who are willing to share their
          knowledge as much as I want to learn. At the end of the day, my
          primary goal is to create something beautiful with people that
          bring out the best in me.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably
          snowboarding, traveling, petting dogs, or learning a new song on
          my uke.
